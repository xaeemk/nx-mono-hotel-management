## Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Deployment
1. **Deploy AWS Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-aws-infrastructure.sh production
   ```

2. **Verify Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
   ```

3. **Configure Secrets**
   ```bash
   # Update Kubernetes secrets with production values
   kubectl create secret generic database-secret \
     --from-literal=url="$PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL" \
     --namespace=nx-mono-production
   ```

### Phase 2: Application Deployment
1. **Deploy Applications via GitHub Actions**
   - Merge staging to main branch
   - Trigger production deployment workflow
   - Monitor deployment progress

2. **Database Migration**
   ```bash
   # Run database migrations
   kubectl exec -it <api-gateway-pod> -n nx-mono-production -- npm run db:migrate
   ```

3. **Seed Initial Data**
   ```bash
   # Seed production data
   kubectl exec -it <api-gateway-pod> -n nx-mono-production -- npm run db:seed
   ```

### Phase 3: Validation
1. **Run Validation Tests**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/validate-deployment.sh production
   ```

2. **Load Testing**
   ```bash
   npm run test:load
   ```

3. **Security Testing**
   ```bash
   # Run security scans
   npm run test:security
   ```

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### 1. DNS Configuration

- [ ] Create monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Test alert mechanisms

### 3. Documentation Update
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Document production URLs
- [ ] Update runbooks for operations team
- [ ] Create incident response procedures

### 4. Team Onboarding
- [ ] Provide production access to team members
- [ ] Conduct production environment walkthrough
- [ ] Share monitoring and alerting information
- [ ] Document escalation procedures
