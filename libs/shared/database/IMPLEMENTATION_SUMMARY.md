# Phase 1 Data Model & Migrations - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. PostgreSQL Schema Design

- **Guests Table**: Comprehensive guest management with support for individual, corporate, VIP, and group guests
- **Rooms Table**: Complete room inventory with amenities, status tracking, and accessibility features
- **Rate Plans Table**: Flexible pricing with date validity, multipliers, and booking conditions
- **Reservations Table**: Full reservation lifecycle with group booking support
- **Payments Table**: Multi-method payment processing with gateway integration
- **Ledger Entries Table**: Double-entry bookkeeping with partitioning for high volume

### 2. Advanced Database Features

#### 🔐 Auditing System

- **Automatic Change Tracking**: All CRUD operations are logged with old/new values
- **User Context**: Captures user ID, IP address, user agent, and session ID
- **Field-Level Changes**: Tracks exactly which fields changed in each update
- **Audit Triggers**: PostgreSQL triggers automatically populate audit_logs table

#### 📊 Table Partitioning

- **Monthly Partitions**: Ledger entries partitioned by transaction_date for performance
- **Automatic Management**: Functions to create future partitions and drop old ones
- **24-Month Retention**: Configurable data retention policy
- **Performance Optimization**: Partition pruning for faster queries

#### 🔒 Optimistic Locking

- **Version Control**: Each record has a version field that increments on updates
- **Concurrency Control**: Prevents lost updates in multi-user scenarios
- **Automatic Triggers**: PostgreSQL triggers handle version incrementing

### 3. Prisma Integration

- **Complete Schema**: All tables defined with proper relationships and constraints
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with generated types
- **Migrations**: Structured migration files for database versioning
- **Client Generation**: Optimized Prisma client with custom output directory

### 4. Database Utilities

- **Connection Management**: Singleton pattern with proper cleanup
- **Audit Context Helper**: `withAuditContext()` function for setting user context
- **Partition Manager**: Class for automated partition maintenance
- **Performance Views**: Pre-built views for common reporting needs

### 5. Comprehensive Seeding

- **Sample Data**: Realistic hotel data including guests, rooms, reservations
- **Relationship Integrity**: Proper foreign key relationships maintained
- **Business Logic**: Sample data follows real-world hotel operations
- **Audit Trail**: Seed operations create audit records

### 6. Performance Optimization

- **Strategic Indexing**: Indexes on common query patterns and foreign keys
- **Full-Text Search**: GIN indexes for guest name and email searching
- **Partial Indexes**: Conditional indexes for active records only
- **Concurrent Creation**: Non-blocking index creation for production

### 7. Maintenance Scripts

- **Partition Maintenance**: Automated script for partition lifecycle management
- **Health Checks**: Monitoring for partition integrity and orphaned records
- **Dry Run Support**: Safe testing of maintenance operations
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed operation logging for monitoring
